Your	task	is	to	implement	a	simple	program	in	any	language	of	your	choice	that	reverses	the	content
of	a	file,	i.e.	previously	first	byte	of	the	file	becomes	the	last	byte	and	vice versa.
Make	sure	to	implement	it	in	most	optimal	way,	to	be	able	to	handle	very	large	files	efficiently,	as	
aside	from	correctness	of	the	solution,	it	will	be	the	primary	grading	criteria.
Submit	a	single	file â€“ the	source	code	of	your	solution. Solution	should	be	runnable	in	one	of	the	
following	operating	systems:	Windows,	Linux	or	UNIX.
Hint: Consider	the	block	structure	of	the	file	system
